Personal Finance Coach - 403 Forbidden Access Page Template

This template displays when a user tries to access a resource they don't have permission for.

Error Context:
- Triggered by authorization failures (not authentication)
- HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden)
- User is authenticated but lacks required permissions

Common Scenarios:
- Accessing admin-only routes without admin role
- Trying to view another user's private data
- Missing required permissions for specific features
- Role-based access control violations

Template Purpose:
- Clearly explain access is denied
- Differentiate from authentication (login) issues
- Provide path back to accessible content
- Maintain professional security messaging

Security Considerations:
- Doesn't reveal what the protected resource contains
- Doesn't hint at what permissions would be needed
- Professional messaging maintains application security
- Logged for security monitoring

Authentication vs Authorization:
- 401: User not logged in (authentication failure)
- 403: User logged in but lacks permission (authorization failure)

Usage in Application:
- Can be triggered by @requires_role decorator
- May be used for future admin features
- Protects sensitive financial data access
